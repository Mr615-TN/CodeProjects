# Simple Hugging Face Python file

This python file just calls one of the three models that are in the file itself (you have to make sure that two of the three are commented out so that the api calls only one of the models) and makes a simple short story

Also, you need to make sure that you have a virtual environment created and have huggingface_hub installed
